Abstract
This document describes the proposed project topic Special Topics in Software Engineering. The document further describes the project statement, project stakeholder, proposed technologies as well as the features to be implemented. Agile development methodology would be followed for this project.
Project Statement
	Our project focuses on the use of restaurant menus from around UOIT and within UOIT. Currently, many local restaurants in and around UOIT do not have an online web interface to allow for placing an order for food of their choosing. Also when a person wants to order a take-out meal, he has to wait till the meal gets prepared and is ready to take-out. Our implementation allows the general food consumers to interact with an online web interface to place order to multiple restaurants in and around UOIT for quick and efficient pick up at the time of their choosing.
Project Stakeholder
	The primary stakeholders for this project will include two group of people. It includes restaurant owner/manager and the customer that normally get take out from those restaurants. In order to gather requirements for the implementation, we will conduct survey and interviews with both group of people.
Proposed Technologies
Our project will fully leverage the capabilities or cloud computing, ruby on rails, JQuery, JavaScript , CSS and HTTP to develop and deploy our advance integrated fast food ordering system. 
Features to be implemented
Our implementation will have 3 different interfaces, providing appropriate features to various users.
The first interface is for the regular costumer who search restaurants in and around UOIT and can place an order for pickup. The customer can include the pick-up time and can include any particular comments he wants the restaurant to know. 
2nd type of interface will be for the restaurant where they can see which order are placed along with the pick-up times and special notes. 
3rd type of interface is for the admin interface where the owner of the restaurant can track the number of orders placed, amount of money made and various other data analytics.
